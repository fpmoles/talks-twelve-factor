# 12 Factor Application Development

## Abstract
Today's modern systems have global reach, and as such public, private, and hybrid clouds are the place to deploy your applications. The issue with many of these solutions, however, is that many parts of application development that work on big iron servers are no longer in play. Limited if any file systems, distributed backing resources, and complex team locations and structures need a newer way of doing things. 12 factor applications, or cloud native applications attempt to bring agile development and cloud resources into coherence.

This presentation will focus on the twelve distinct components, workflows, and techniques for cloud based application development. It will be language agnostic, and instead focus on the principles behind the actual development.
